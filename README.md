# ted: text editor

My minimalist web-based [text editor](https://kipre.github.io/ted/).


Features:
    
    - no tab support
    - depends only on tfjs (optional)
    - multiple cursors
    - neural-network-based highlighting
    - partially auto-edited
    
Limitations:

    - there are a lot
    - works only on chrome (because of FileSystem API)
    - no unicode support
